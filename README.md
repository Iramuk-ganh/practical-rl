## About
 My solutions to the [Practical Reinforcement Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl) by Coursera and the Higher School of Economics by the National Research University, which is part 4 out of 7 by the [Advanced Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml).

 Assignments can be found inside each week's folders and they're displayed in commented Jupyter notebooks along with quizzes.
